---------------------APPLICATION STATEMENT------------------------------

An application was developed that displays markers on a map from a JSON file and shows detailed information when clicked on. The markers are filtered according to the type of place. The app was created using React Native and Expo. Added functionality to generate new markers and calculate distances to nearby places. Problems were faced with image uploading, but were solved by adding a number to the URL based on the date and time. The app was designed to run on a single screen and used filters from React Native's Picker library.

In terms of the user interface, we opted to have a single screen where clicking on a marker displays a modal page with detailed information about the location. When the back to map button is clicked, the modal closes. This allows the entire application to run on a single screen. In addition, React Native's Picker library was used to create the filters in a simple way, managing place types and related filters.
